A OID class for strongly-typed ASN.1 Object Identifiers in D. This will
eventually be incorporated into a full-blown ASN.1 library, which I hope to
push to the D Standard Library.

## Basic Usage

There are two constructors to create OID objects. One takes an array of numbers;
another takes an array of OIDNode structs.

```d
OID oid = new OID([1, 3, 6, 1]);
OID oid = new OID(1, 3, 6, 1);
OID oid = new OID(
    OIDNode(1, "iso"),
    OIDNode(3, ""),
    OIDNode(6, "dod"),
    OIDNode(1, "internet")
);
```

If you create an OID using the OID(int[]) constructor, none of the OID nodes
have labels / descriptors. You can set them with these methods:

```d
oid.descriptor(0, "iso"); // 0 is the index
oid.descriptors([ "iso", "", "dod", "internet"]);
oid.descriptors("iso", "", "dod", "internet");
```

Once you have created the OID, you can return the OID in various formats. For
all but the URN, if a node has a descriptor, the output will display the
descriptor instead of the number.

```d
oid.numericArray // [ 1L, 3L, 6L, 1L ]
oid.dotNotation // iso.3.dod.internet
oid.asn1Notation // {iso 3 dod internet}
oid.iriNotation // /iso/3/dod/internet
oid.urnNotation // urn:oid:1:3:6:1
```

And, of course, you have the length property (read-only):

```d
oid.length // 4
```
